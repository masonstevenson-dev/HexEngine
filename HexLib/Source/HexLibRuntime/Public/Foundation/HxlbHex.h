// Fundamentally, a "Hex" is just a set of 2D axial coordinates. However, the user or the system may have decided to
// associate additional information with these coordinates (such as an actor or some other game-specific data). If such
// information exists, a UHxlbHex will be instantiated to track it.
//
// Note on performance:
//   The plugin currently expects that users will create on average no more than 10,000 hexes per map. The current hard
//   limit is ~65,536 hexes since we have chosen to use render target sizes of 256px x 256px. From manual testing,
//   creating individual UObjects on the order of 1000s seems to be reasonable. If in the future, we ever need to
//   support creating 100k+ hexes, we may need to revamp this entire system to store data in contiguous blocks and then
//   create proxy objects for user editing.
